# Name and Age Form

This is a simple web page. You can write your name and your age. The page checks your information and gives you a message.

## What it uses

- HTML (to create the page)
- CSS (to design the page)
- JavaScript (to make it work)
- Font Awesome (for social media icons)

## What it does

- You write your name and your age
- If something is missing or wrong, it shows an error
- If everything is good, it shows a nice message
- The "Send" button disappears and "Clean" appears
- There are icons for LinkedIn, Facebook and Google (they are just images, they don’t work)
